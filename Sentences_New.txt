<p> At Rent By Owner, we want everyone to be an owner, just as we want everyone to be a traveler. In creating more travelers, hopefully we are creating more owners. And in creating more owners, we will be creating more travelers. You can <a class="static-page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.upnextgroup.com/about-us">read more about our core values</a> for UpNext Group here. We also look forward to showing you what we are creating in the months and years ahead. Stay tuned.</p>
<p> Historically, Rent By Owner has been a meta brand, connecting travelers to travel sellers, and since 2013, this has served us well. We believe that by helping more than a million travelers, we now have a great base on which to build something new and spectacular. Going forward, we need to build closer relationships with both sides of the market--both travelers and owners-- so as to bring them together in new ways and into a deeper relationship with each other and the communities into which the traveler journeys.</p>
<p> At Rent By Owner, we are focusing on the Alternative Accommodations market. We believe this market encourages people to have a more authentic travel experience in the communities, homes, and places of others. Creating a direct connection between a traveler and an owner creates a more meaningful experience. Sharing cultures, recipes, local tips, insights, pride, activities, art, food, entertainment... sights, sounds, smells and senses. These are the memories worth sharing.</p>
<p> We believe life is better when you venture out and explore the world. You meet other people, you connect with family & friends, you do more business, and you have new experiences. In short, travel creates memories. Travel brings people closer together and fosters better understanding of each other and ourselves.</p>
<p> Rent By Owner relies on the eco-score created by <a class="static-page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.onedegreeleft.com">One Degree Left</a>, a sister-company operated by parent company UpNext Group. This property looks at a number of factors to help score all properties based on a variety of sustainability factors. We believe that we can help elevate properties that have good environmental and sustainability practices. If we identify a property that has good practices, we will rank that property higher in our search results than other properties. By ranking these properties higher, hopefully they will be booked with greater frequency and nudge behavior by a small factor… by ‘one degree’ if you will. While it is not perfect, it is part of our commitment to driving more sustainable travel.</p>
<p> Rent By Owner was launched first in 2013 and has evolved as a business since then. It is part of the UpNext Group family of websites. UpNext Group helps travelers find the perfect place to stay, easily comparing rentals, condos, hotels, RVs, boats, activities, and resorts across an ever-growing network of niche travel brands and websites. Rent By Owner operates in multiple countries and languages.</p
<p> We strive to show accurate pricing for a property based on the lowest nightly rate we have been able to find for a property. For the most accurate pricing, please input your date range and search for the property. You will be referred over to the partner or the property owner’s own website to confirm the specific pricing. We are working on functionality to find you the best price across multiple websites for the property you are interested in. Stay tuned as we refine this feature.</p>
<p> Each property listed on our website has a detailed listing. These listings often include photos, amenities, property policies, and more. This information has been received from our partners, directly from the property manager/owner themselves, or from information we have managed to find online about the property from multiple sources. This has also included information we may have extracted from analysing the images of the photos, the neighborhood in which the property is located, or similar properties in the same complex. However, Rent By Owner is not responsible or liable for the accuracy of these results. While we attempt to be as accurate as possible, should you have a specific question or concern, we encourage you to contact the property owner directly via the website to which we refer you to.</p>
<p> If your property has been removed from a partner’s website, it is possible that we still have cached the listing or are in the process of having it be removed from our website. In time, it will also be unpublished from our network of sites. If you would like to remove it faster, please <a class="static-page-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.upnextgroup.com/contact-us" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact us</a> and we will see if we can help.</p>
<p> At Rent By Owner, have listed the properties from our partners, including many online travel agents (OTAs) and direct via channel managers who distribute their inventory onto sites like ours, and the entire UpNext Group network. It is likely that you had agreed for the added distribution when you signed up with their services. We refer all our visitors to our partners or direct to our property owner’s sites and do not take bookings on our site directly. Our job is to help them promote their inventory and sell more travel and ensure that fewer nights go un-booked. There is no additional cost to listing on our network.</p>
<p> To make changes to your reservation, please visit the partner’s website with whom you booked. As an affiliate provider, we consolidate multiple travel sites in one easy search; however, we cannot access your reservation information. Please check your email for reservation details to see the partner with whom you have booked. At this time, no bookings are made directly via our website, so we are unable to help you modify, cancel, or change a reservation.</p>
